# A new task
We started with the introduction for a new small project we will work on during the next few lessons.

This program will simulate sheep on a field where they eat, move around and die. Later on we will add more elements, but for now, this is what we start with.

The concrete rules are [here](https://github.com/rubyseeds/sheep_simulation/blob/master/README.md).
