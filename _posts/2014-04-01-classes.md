#Recap

We introduced Ruby classes and classes in general. We learned about different parts of a class:

- Instance variables
- Methods
- `initialize` method
- Passing parameters to the `initialize` method
- Getter methods
- Setter methods
- `attr_accessor`
- `attr_reader`


##Tasks: 

1. Create a class `CdPlayer`
2. with method `next_track`
3. with method `previous_track`
4. Getter for current track

##Additional task:

- Enable the player to set a track directly i.e. 6. But consider that
  the new track needs to be checked if it is not bigger than the amount
of tracks.


##Reminder:

Reloading a file in irb works like this `load "filename.rb"`

## Example file:

- [Bike class](https://github.com/rubyseeds/materials/blob/gh-pages/files/bike_class.rb)
