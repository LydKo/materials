# Recap
In this session we took the burger program [from this exercise](http://rubyseeds.github.io/materials/2014/04/15/zen-of-ruby.html) and enhanced it:

1. The program should not quit after the user made an input but ask for another input until the user wants to finish his order
2. Print out the total price of all ordered burgers

The finished program is [here](https://github.com/rubyseeds/materials/blob/gh-pages/files/burger_enhancement.rb).
