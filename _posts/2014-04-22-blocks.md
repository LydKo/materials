  - This [Chaosradio episode (German)](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/cr152.html) discusses these topics very deeply

# Blocks, Procs, Lambdas

We introduced Blocks, Procs and Lambdas.
- [Example file 1](https://github.com/rubyseeds/materials/blob/gh-pages/files/blocks.rb)

# Task

Write a method `my_map` which takes an array and a block as an argument. It should call the block on each element.

This test code here:

```Ruby
  c = my_map([4,5,6,7]) do |param|
    param * param
  end
```
  
Should output this:

```Ruby
  puts c
  # => 16, 25, 36, 49
```
