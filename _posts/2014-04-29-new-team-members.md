# Recap and new team members
We are happy to welcome Lydia and Suzanne as new members in our group. So this session was about introducing each other.
Later the [homework](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/0/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb) was discussed in detail.

# Exercise
Our new members where tasked with the [`case-when` exercise](http://rubyseeds.github.io/materials/2014/04/15/zen-of-ruby.html), the others enhanced their version in the following way:

1. The program should not quit after the user made an input but ask for another input until the user wants to finish his order
2. Print out the total price of all ordered burgers
